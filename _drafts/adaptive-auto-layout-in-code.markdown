title:  "Adaptive Auto Layout in Code"
categories: blog ios
---

[Matthew Sanders][matthew] posted an excellent article in September 2014 on [Adaptive Layouts for iPhone 6][matthew-article]. It was written as an instructive piece so I followed along in Xcode 6 recreating the examples using Interface Builder to produce views and auto layout constraints visually.

The last half of the article focused on building an adaptive layout for a hypothetical Instagram interface that shifted information in landscape orientation. I replicated the final results using Interface Builder however I was not impressed by the tediousness of installing, finding, adjusting, and inspecting auto layout constraints visually across multiple [size class traits][size-class-traits].

The purpose of this article is to illustrate how that adapative Instagram interface can be recreated in code. I'll be using [Masonry][masonry], a light-weight layout framework which wraps Auto Layout with a nicer syntax.

## Simple Squares

To illustrate the succinct layout DSL provided by [Masonry][masonry] we can recreate the coloured squares example from the first half of Matthew's article.

{% include figure.html caption="Image by Matthew Sanders" asset="/assets/adaptive-instagram/Constraint-5.gif" %}

The code snippet below creates the Auto Layout constraints for the coloured squares in the `UIView` method [updateConstraints][update-constraints]. The chainable expressive syntax of Masonry shines through. The entire view code is available as working example on my [github][masonry-squares-fork].

{% highlight objective-c %}
- (void)updateConstraints
{
    UIView *superView = self;
    UIEdgeInsets padding = UIEdgeInsetsMake(20, 20, 0, 20);

    [self.blueSquareView mas_makeConstraints:^(MASConstraintMaker *make) {

        // Make the view a square
        make.height.equalTo(self.blueSquareView.mas_width);

        // Pin the view to the superview
        make.top.and.left.equalTo(superView).with.insets(padding);

        // Make the blue square width equal to the pink square
        make.width.equalTo(self.pinkSquareView);

        // Pin the blue square right edge to the pink square left edge
        make.right.equalTo(self.pinkSquareView.mas_left).with.offset(-20);
    }];

    [self.pinkSquareView mas_makeConstraints:^(MASConstraintMaker *make) {

        make.top.and.right.equalTo(superView).with.insets(padding);
        make.height.equalTo(self.pinkSquareView.mas_width);
    }];

    [super updateConstraints];
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Adaptive Instagram Example

Recreating the adaptive layout for Matthew's hypothetical Instagram was straightforward. You can follow along in Xcode by cloning the source for this app from my [github][github-app].

{% include figure.html caption="Recreating Matthew's Adapative Instagram Example" asset="/assets/adaptive-instagram/adaptive-instagram-mike.gif" %}

The graphic below denotes the four main subviews of our hypothetical Instagram application. The challenge will be to manage layout constraints in code as the [size class traits][size-class-traits] change during device rotation.

{% include figure.html caption="Layout Subviews" asset="/assets/adaptive-instagram/layout-overview.jpg" %}

When the interface layout changes to landscape our constraints must slide the `AuthorView` to the right, and move the `LikesView` rightwards and upwards. The `PictureView` will remove its full width constraint meanwhile the `HeaderView` maintains its layout in both orientations. This process must be reversed as the phone rotates back to portrait orientation.

> Note: As of iOS8 all rotation-related methods are deprecated. Instead rotations are treated as a change in the size of the view controllerâ€™s view. So when we talk about rotations and orientatons we're really talking about changes in [size class traits][size-class-traits] which are part of the new `UITraitCollection` class.

#### Generic Constraints

Our first task is to install the constraints for the generic size class, and by generic we mean constraints which apply for both regular and compact [size class traits][size-class-traits]. For Matthew's article which uses Interface Builder this corresponds to the _any-width any-height_ setting.

{% include figure.html caption="Generic Constraints" asset="/assets/adaptive-instagram/generic-constraints.jpg" %}

As seen in the generic constraints graphic above, the `HeaderView` has a fixed height and its left, right, and top edges are pinned to the super view. Our `PictureView` will always be displayed as a square so we define a contraint equating its height and width.  The `AuthorView` will also have a fixed height and its top edge will always be pinned to the bottom edge of the `HeaderView`.

The following view controller function when called will create and install these generic constraints.

{% highlight objective-c %}
- (void)installGenericConstraints
{
    [self.headerView mas_makeConstraints:^(MASConstraintMaker *make) {
        make.height.equalTo(@60);
        make.left.right.and.top.equalTo(self.view);
    }];

    [self.pictureView mas_makeConstraints:^(MASConstraintMaker *make) {
        make.height.equalTo(self.pictureView.mas_width);
        make.left.equalTo(self.view);
    }];

    [self.authorView mas_makeConstraints:^(MASConstraintMaker *make) {
        addObject:make.height.equalTo(@50);
        make.top.equalTo(self.headerView.mas_bottom);
    }];
}
{% endhighlight %}

#### Portrait Constraints

The next step is to install the constraints relevant only for the portrait orientation. Determining which constraints are required is a process of _filling-in-the-blanks_ from the generic constraints illustration.

{% include figure.html caption="Portrait Constraints" asset="/assets/adaptive-instagram/portrait-constraints.jpg" %}

The portrait specific constraints include pinning the `AuthorView` left and right edges to the super view, which makes it span the full width. Pin the top and right edge of the `PictureView` to the bottom of the `AuthorView` and the right edge of the superview respectively. The `LikesView` does not have any generic constraints so defining them is straightforward: pin its top edge to the bottom of the `PictureView` and pin its left and right edges to the superview which makes it span the full width.

The following view controller function creates the portrait layout constraints. The Masonry constraint maker `MASConstraintMaker` conveniently returns the constraint created which we add to an array property. We'll use this array later to uninstall the constraints as the device changes orientation.

{% highlight objective-c %}
- (void)installPhonePortraitConstraints
{
    NSMutableArray *constraints = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];

    [self.authorView mas_makeConstraints:^(MASConstraintMaker *make) {
        [constraints addObject:make.left.and.right.equalTo(self.view)];
    }];

    [self.pictureView mas_makeConstraints:^(MASConstraintMaker *make) {
        [constraints addObject:make.top.equalTo(self.authorView.mas_bottom)];
        [constraints addObject:make.right.equalTo(self.view)];
    }];

    [self.likesView mas_makeConstraints:^(MASConstraintMaker *make) {
        [constraints addObject:make.top.equalTo(self.pictureView.mas_bottom).with.offset(5)];
        [constraints addObject:make.left.and.right.equalTo(self.view)];
    }];

    self.phonePortraitConstraints = [constraints copy];
}
{% endhighlight %}

#### Landscape Constraints

The next step is to install the constraints relevant only to landscape orientation. Again determining which constraints are required is a process of _filling-in-the-blanks_ from the generic constraints illustration.

{% include figure.html caption="Landscape Constraints" asset="/assets/adaptive-instagram/landscape-constraints.jpg" %}

The landscape specific constraints include pinning the `PictureView` top and bottom edges to the `HeaderView` bottom edge and super view bottom edge respectively. The left edge of the `AuthorView` is pinned to the right edge of the `PictureView`. The `LikesView` top and left edges are pinned to the `AuthorView` top edge and `PictureView` left edge respectively.

Attempting to pin the right edge of the `AuthorView` and `LikesView` to the super view will lead to unsatisfiable constraints. The _less-than-or-equal-to_ width constraint allows the views to expand to the intrinsic width of their subviews.

The following view controller function creates the landscape layout constraints. Once again we store the constraints in a view controller array property which we'll use later to uninstall the constraints.

{% highlight objective-c %}
- (void)installPhoneLandscapeConstraints
{
    NSMutableArray *constraints = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];

    [self.authorView mas_makeConstraints:^(MASConstraintMaker *make) {
        [constraints addObject:make.left.equalTo(self.pictureView.mas_right)];
        [constraints addObject:make.width.lessThanOrEqualTo(self.pictureView)];
    }];

    [self.pictureView mas_makeConstraints:^(MASConstraintMaker *make) {
        [constraints addObject:make.top.equalTo(self.headerView.mas_bottom)];
        [constraints addObject:make.bottom.equalTo(self.view)];
    }];

    [self.likesView mas_makeConstraints:^(MASConstraintMaker *make) {
        [constraints addObject:make.top.equalTo(self.authorView.mas_bottom)];
        [constraints addObject:make.left.equalTo(self.pictureView.mas_right)];
        [constraints addObject:make.width.lessThanOrEqualTo(self.pictureView)];
    }];

    self.phoneLandscapeConstraints = [constraints copy];
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Toggling Constraints

The functions we just discussed are concerned with creating constraints. As mentioned earlier the challenge will be to manage layout constraints as the [size class traits][size-class-traits] change during device rotation.

The following function when called will install the constraints matching the device orientation for a trait collection and uninstall the constraints which are no longer relevant. The _uninstall_ prefixed helper methods are simply uninstalling the constraints which we stored a reference to earlier.

{% highlight objective-c %}
- (void)toggleConstraintsForTraitCollection:(UITraitCollection *)traitCollection
{
    if ([traitCollection mk_matchesPhoneLandscape]) {

        [self uninstallPhonePortraitConstraints];
        [self installPhoneLandscapeConstraints];

    }
    else if ([traitCollection mk_matchesPhonePortrait]) {

        [self uninstallPhoneLandscapeConstraints];
        [self installPhonePortraitConstraints];
    }

    [self updateViewConstraints];
}

- (void)uninstallPhonePortraitConstraints
{
    for (MASConstraint *constraint in self.phonePortraitConstraints) {
        [constraint uninstall];
    }
}

- (void)uninstallPhoneLandscapeConstraints
{
    for (MASConstraint *constraint in self.phoneLandscapeConstraints) {
        [constraint uninstall];
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

> Note: Helper methods `mk_matchesPhoneLandscape` and `mk_matchesPhonePortrait` are from a category on `UITraitCollection`, see [source on my github][github-app-category].

> Note: This approach results in the constraints getting installed, uninstalled, and reinstalled as the device rotates back and forth. An alternative approach could be the `activate` and `deactive` api methods for `MASConstraint` however it just didn't work for me. Your results may vary.

## Wiring the View Controller

Connecting all this up to our view controller is straightforward, all the heavy lifting is covered by the previous helper methods.

Override the `UIViewController` template method `updateViewConstraints` and install the generic constraints which will always be active. Then call helper method `toggleConstraintsForTraitCollection:` which will install constraints for the current [size class traits][size-class-traits].

{% highlight objective-c %}
#pragma mark UIViewController template methods

- (void)updateViewConstraints
{
    if (!self.didSetConstraints) {

        self.didSetConstraints = YES;
        [self installGenericConstraints];
        [self toggleConstraintsForTraitCollection:self.traitCollection];
    }

    [super updateViewConstraints];
}
{% endhighlight %}

> Note: There's a potential problem with `updateViewConstraints` as it can be called more than once when the view initialises and when the size class traits change during rotation. We guard against double installation of constraints with a flag which from my research seems to be current best practice.

The final step is to implement protocol method `viewWillTransitionToSize:withTransitionCoordinator:` which communicates changes in size class traits for the view controller. Its body calls helper method `toggleConstraintsForTraitCollection:` which will install and uninstall constraints as required.

{% highlight objective-c %}
#pragma mark UIContentContainer protocol methods

- (void)willTransitionToTraitCollection:(UITraitCollection *)newCollection withTransitionCoordinator:(id<UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinator>)coordinator
{
    [self toggleConstraintsForTraitCollection:newCollection];
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Final Remarks

Working with Auto Layout and adapting your interfaces to different screen sizes for iOS is more important that ever. Using Interface Builder and Storyboards will get you a long way, and I'm not suggesting that you banish them from your workflow. However for all but the most simple of applications you will need to get into the trenches and write layout constraints in code. I hope this article will help you in that task.
