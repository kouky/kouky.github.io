I'm an iOS Engineer working at [Canva](https://canva.com) a platform which makes design simple for everyone. I'm living at the iconic [Bondi Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bondi_Beach) in Sydney, Australia.

My professional development has been shaped by the teams and products I have worked on. I also attend conferences, organize and participate in community events, and contribute to open source projects.

This site hosts some of my extended writing efforts which I hope you find informative.
