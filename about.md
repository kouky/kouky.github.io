I'm an iOS Engineer currently working at [Canva](https://canva.com) a platform which makes design simple for everyone. I'm located in Sydney, Australia.

My professional development has been shaped by the teams and products I have worked on. I also attend conferences, organise and participate in community events, and contribute to open source projects.

This site hosts some of my extended writing efforts which I hope you find informative.
