I'm an iOS developer currently working on indoor positioning using Bluetooth low energy. I'm located in Melbourne, Australia's coffee and art capital.

My professional development has been shaped by the teams and products I have worked on. I also attend conferences, organise and participate in community events, and contribute to open source projects.

This site hosts some of my extended writing efforts which I hope you find informative.

Feel free to contact me if you're interested in working together.
